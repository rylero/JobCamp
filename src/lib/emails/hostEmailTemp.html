Hello,<br>
Apologies if you receive this email twice. We had a technical blip!<br>
Thank you again for hosting Los Gatos High School students for job shadow day on Monday, March 10. This email is a check-in to let you know students are currently picking their top choices on <a href="">JobCamp.org</a>.  We will run a lottery to assign students to positions on Feb 26th.  You will be notified of which student(s) will be attending your job shadow day no later than February 28th.<br>
<br>
On the 28th, students will be notified of their assignment and at that point, will have your name/email address.  You should expect an introductory email and confirmation of the student's attendance.<br>
<br>
If students are required to sign any forms, be sure they are linked in your JobCamp.org posting, or email admin@jobcamp.org for help in getting the documents out to the students. You can go to <a href="https://jobcamp.org/lghs/view-companies">https://jobcamp.org/lghs/view-companies</a> to see what the students are able to view.<br>
<br>
Please let us know if you have any questions. <br>
Warm regards,<br>
Heather LeRoy<br>
JobCamp.org Team<br>
