Hi,
${name} plans to participate in Los Gatos High School's JobCamp day on March 10, 2025. JobCamp provides an opportunity for high school students to learn about various careers by shadowing local professionals. 

Los Gatos High School requires a permission slip be completed for every student who plans to participate. This link is specific to your child's JobCamp registration.

Our 2024 event placed 300 students to over 60 companies and the students learned about careers from engineering to real estate and marketing to medicine. You can view the list of participating companies <a href="jobcamp.org/lghs/view-companies">here.</a> Also view <a href="jobcamp.org/faq">these FAQs</a> for more information on what to expect. 

We would love your support to encourage your child to research companies and careers they are interested in and select their top choices. At the end of February, we will run a lottery against the students and their choices. You and your child will be notified of their winning position.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
Regards,
JobCamp Team
